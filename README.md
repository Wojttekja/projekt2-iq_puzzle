IQ puzzle solver with vizualization using matplotlib
Reads boards as numpy two-dimensional arrays
Puzzles are stored as mini numpy arrays
function solve() solves puzzles recursively
only_text.py solves puzzles without graphical showing and prints only final solution, used for testing the algorithm
Project made for WDI (Introduction to informatics), my university subject
